Personal Budget Tracker
Scenario:
You are building a simple personal budget tracker to help users manage their monthly
expenses. The tracker will allow users to input their income and expenses, categorize them, and
view a summary in a table format. This project will help you practice using HTML tags such as
headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and semantic tags, while also organizing content               
effectively.
Requirements:
1.​ HTML Structure:
○​ Use appropriate semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <section>, and
<article>.
○​ Organize your content into distinct sections with clear headings.
2.​ Sections of the Budget Tracker:
○​ Header Section:
■​ Use the <header> tag for the website’s title (e.g., "Personal Budget
Tracker") and navigation links (optional, e.g., links to Home, Add
Expense, View Budget).
○​ Introduction Section:
■​ Use a <section> tag to introduce the purpose of the tracker.
■​ Add a heading (<h1>) for the title and a paragraph (<p>) explaining how
the tracker works.
○​ Add Income/Expense Section:
■​ Use a form (<form>) for users to input their income and expenses.
■​ Include the following form elements:
■​ Income (number input)
■​ Expense (number input)
■​ Category (dropdown or radio buttons for categories like "Food",
"Transportation", "Entertainment", etc.)
■​ Date (date input)
■​ Submit button
○​ Budget Summary Section:
■​ Display a table (<table>) that shows a summary of all income and
expenses entered by the user.
■​ The table should include the following columns:
■​ Category
■​ Amount
■​ Date
■​ Type (Income or Expense)○​ Footer Section:
■​ Include a footer with information about the tracker, such as version
number or links to privacy policy and terms of use.
3.​ Code Style:
○​ Follow proper indentation and HTML syntax.
○​ Ensure all tags are properly closed and nested.
Learning Goals:
●​ HTML Tags: Learn to use basic HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.
●​ Forms: Practice creating and styling HTML forms, including different types of input fields
like numbers, dates, and dropdowns.
●​ Tables: Learn how to structure data in a table format with the <table> tag.
●​ Semantic HTML: Understand how semantic HTML elements like <header>,
<footer>, and <section> make a webpage more accessible and readable.
●​ Organization: Organize your HTML structure to create a logical flow and user-friendly
interface.
